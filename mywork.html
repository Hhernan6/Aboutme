                        <figcaption>This project was my first ever project using CSS and HTML. We had six weeks to create a eCommerce website. I am very happy with my result knowing that 
                            I did not know any CSS and HTML. I also had to manage my time during those six weeks because I was working and working on my website at the same time. 
                            This made me realize that I wanted to become a software engineer. I strive to improve my front-end skills and soon learn back-end languages.

                        <figcaption>For this wesbite, we had one day to create a two page about website on whatever we wanted. I chose to do a about page on David Hasselhoff.
                            I put a lot of funny pictures on it and made it a entertaining website. This gave me a big confident boost on my skills I have so far in HTML and CSS. 
                            I am very satisfied with the result for the time that was given. This is one of very first mini projects and look forward to improving my code on 
                            future projects.

                <h3>Checkboard Challenge</h3>
                <p>For this Challenge, I had to create a checkerboard using a table. At first it was hard for me on how to use the table to actually get it to work.
                    After figuring it out, it was not as hard I thought it was.

                <h3>Javascript Challenge</h3>
                <p>For this challenge we had to use Javascript to create a ordered list of last name in alphabetical order. The challenge was very
                    challenging. I had to get help from professional engineers and classmates. The whole experience was great. I am still new to Javascript and I can not
                    wait to learn it.
