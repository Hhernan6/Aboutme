                <h3>Road to Hire Gateway Project</h3>
                <p>This project was my first ever project using CSS and HTML. This was the biggest
                    challenge I have ever face. We had six weeks to create a eCommerce website. I am very happy with my result knowing I did not know any CSS and HTML. I also
                    had to manage my time during those six weeks because I was working and working on my website at the same time. This made me realize that I
                    wanted to become a software engineer. This was my foundations and I can not wait to see my progress.

                <h3>One Day Project</h3>
                <p>For this wesbite, we had one day to create a two page website on whatever we wanted. I chose to do a about page on David Hasselhoff.
                    I put a lot of funny pictures on it and make a entertaining website. This gave me a big confident boost 
                    on my skills I have so far in HTML and CSS. I did very well for the time that was given. This is one of 
                    very first mini projects and look forward to improving my code on future projects.

                <h3>Checkboard Challenge</h3>
                <p>For this Challenge, I had to create a checkerboard using a table. At first it was hard for me on how to use the table to actually get it to work.
                    After figuring it out, it was not as hard I thought it was.

                <h3>Javascript Challenge</h3>
                <p>For this challenge we had to use Javascript to create a ordered list of last name in alphabetical order. The challenge was very
                    challenging. I had to get help from professional engineers and classmates. The whole experience was great. I am still new to Javascript and I can not
                    wait to learn it.
