                    <p>I started Road to Hire in June 18, 2018. I had to go through the gateway program which determined if I got in to the actual program. This program 
                        is a huge opportunity that I can not believe I got that chance to be apart of. This program has not only taught me programmimg languages but also
                        skills that I will use throughout my developer career. I still have of a improvement in both the professional and coding aspect. I can not wait to get
                        back end programming languages.
                    </p>
