                        <figcaption>I was born in Michoacan, Mexico in March 4, 1998. I came to the United States when I was just five years old. I do not remember
                        much from Mexico, but I hope to go visit soon. I have four brothers and one sister, I am the youngest. My sibilings and myself had a hard time adapting to the new life we had after
                        arriving to Charlotte, N.C. I have lived in Charlotte ever since.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption> I have both long and short term goals. Some of my short term goals are to graduate from Road to Hire's tech academy, improve on
                            my soft skills and to get a job at Red Ventures as a back-end software engineer. Most of these short term goals will help me achive my main goal 
                            on having a successful career as a software engineer. I want to become the best software engineer, professionally and personally.

                        <figcaption>I have a few hobbies. My main hobby is playing the drums. I play in a mexican music based group on the weekends. We play at private parties
                        like quince√±eras, wedding, birthdays, and baptisms. The good thing about it is that I also get paid for it. I really enjoy it a lot. Some other small 
                        hobbies I have is playing soccer and watching movies.</figcaption>
