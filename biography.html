                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Michoacan, Mexico in March 4, 1998. I came to the United States when I was just five years old. I do not remember
                        much from Mexico. I also do not remember when I came over here. I really hate the fact that I can not remember much about these two things. 
                        I have 5 brothers and one sister and I am the youngest. My sibilings had a hard time adapting to the new life we had. I do remember my first day of kindergarden 
                        and how I cried. It was one of the scariest days of my life.

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p> I have both long and short term goals. I never did good in high school and I regret not trying. I only thought about the obstacles I would face as a undocumented
                        immigrant. It made me think that no matter what, I would never have the career that I wanted. I made it my long term goal to get my college degree and start my career in
                        technology. Road to Hire, a program that is going to make my goal become reality. I always wanted to work in the tech field and getting the opportunity to work the 
                     Red Ventures in the future. Accomplishing this goals will help me achieve my other goals. The goals of helpling my family, being finacially stable, and gaining professional
                    relationships. When I finally accomplish this goal, I wont stop there. I will continue pushing myself being a web developer and getting to the top.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>I have a few hobbies. My main hobby is playing the drums. I play in a mexican music based group on the weekends. We play at private parties
                        like quince√±eras, wedding, birthdays, and baptisms. The good thing about it is that I also get paid for it. I really enjoy it a lot. Some other small 
                        hobbies I have is playing soccer and watching movies.
